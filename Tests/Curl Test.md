### Step 1

Let's try getting an image of a donut!
```zsh
cd ~/Downloads
curl https://wuollet.com/cdn/shop/products/62d88877cc617fba61093959_5edc3fa4e5cf1e383454e182_chocolate_2520yeast_2520donut.jpg?v=1673213080 > donut.png
```
Try it out it's cool!

### Step 2

And now let's get rid of this file
```zsh
cd ~/Downloads
rm donut.png
```
------
And we are done now!
