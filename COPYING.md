### Copying
I'll let anyone copy my code because I think this is a fun little repository where I can put code up and people can use itfor help like it's just code what is so serious about just copying code? If you need help just copy the code and should work for you! Here is a text that is colored in yellow using Z-Shell by the fly:
```zsh
print -Pu2 %F{yellow}Any text!%
```
Alright but anyways, copy my code as much as you want!

Happy coding!
