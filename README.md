### Hello!
You found me in here!
I'm a **small** coder that
just likes making fun stuff :)
I have a [youtube](https://youtube.com/@sergcreate) channel,
and this is my about me:
- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CoderSerg
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Lua, HTML, and ZSH
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: him, his, serg
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started coding 1 year ago
- ğŸ’» I use a mac for all my coding
- ğŸ‘¾ I use the terminal a lot
- ğŸš€ Fun fact: I don't really have a lot of ideas when I code.
